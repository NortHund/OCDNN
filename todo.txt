Phase 5:
-fixed issue related to not identical accuracy with c++ version
-accelerate everything with opencl
-maybe move each layer to its own function to clean up forward_ocl()
-come up with a good way to create or write to buffers in ocl to increase performance - current performance is horrible

export import is bugged, order of layers for output should be input, output, height, width
in exim create weight sums, the dimensions are wrong for matrixW13double jne
