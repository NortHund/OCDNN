Phase 5:
-fixed issue related to not identical accuracy with c++ version
-accelerate everything with opencl
-maybe move each layer to its own function to clean up forward_ocl()
-come up with a good way to create or write to buffers in ocl to increase performance - current performance is horrible

export import is bugged, order of layers for output should be input, output, height, width --fixed
in exim create weight sums, the dimensions are wrong for matrixW13double jne --fixed
weight sum problem mostly fixed, 2-1, 3-1 and 4-1 are still bugged --fixed
matmul and matmul ics --fixed
csc has some random values on the first run after waiting a while. Probably related to csc ocl buffer not being zeroed properly
mystery bug found: W11 and W12 is all zeros, so bin loading/saving not working correctly, it was no tthis
cs compare not designed for 3d tensors, this is a problem for relu/maxpool layer dmr

now 3-1 and 4-1 conv3 have abft error detected, fixed, it was related to weight sum calcs
mystery bug still persists in 4-1 and forward
mystery bug fixed between layers 1-1 and 6-1, was related to max pool wrong kernel size (4 instead of 2)
so it was selecting max values out of bounds
mystery bug still exists in flatmat layers, also output from previous layers doesn't affect flatmat for some reason
