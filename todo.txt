Phase 5:
-fixed issue related to not identical accuracy with c++ version
-accelerate everything with opencl
-maybe move each layer to its own function to clean up forward_ocl()
-come up with a good way to create or write to buffers in ocl to increase performance - current performance is horrible

export import is bugged, order of layers for output should be input, output, height, width --fixed
in exim create weight sums, the dimensions are wrong for matrixW13double jne --fixed
weight sum problem mostly fixed, 2-1, 3-1 and 4-1 are still bugged --fixed
matmul and matmul ics --fixed
csc has some random values on the first run after waiting a while. Probably related to csc ocl buffer not being zeroed properly
