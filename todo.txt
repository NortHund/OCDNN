Phase 5:
-Add cl_mem freeing to the program
-calculate accuracy when running the prediction multiple times
-bug breaks the accuracy of opencl implementation when running prediction multiple times, but not when running any index once
    likely related to not zeroing buffers between runs
-Study and fix the bug related to getting false results from predictions, likely related to layer 6 and result code, maybe biases 5_6
    *Fixed, it was due to W56 going out of bounds
-accelerate everything with opencl
-maybe move each layer to its own function to clean up forward_ocl()
-come up with a good way to create or write to buffers in ocl to increase performance
